First attempt repository 

Hello everyone! I am a college greaduate in an unrelated field who has found interest in IT and coding. I am hoping to learn from this community and hop in to a career as a developer. My main recreational intrest is music. I especially enjoy rock from the 60's to 80's and enjoy country prior to the 2000's.
